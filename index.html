  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Hunter. You probably already knew that though. Anyways, I'm a student at the <a href="http://uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a> who spends less time on school than he should. I like working on projects that help communities use technology to make their lives better. Seriously. I've gotten to work with <a href="http://kippnj.org">some</a> <a href="http://dssg.io">pretty</a> <a href="http://barackobama.com">cool</a> people, and for that, I'm grateful. I spend a lot of time thinking about urbanism, data pipelines and tacos. <a href="mailto:hunter@hunterowens.net">Let's talk</a>.</p>

  <h2>Tools</h2>
  <p>I turn to Python and Javascript most often, with a smattering of Julia, Java/Scala, and C when I feel like it. I really like the idea of reproducible analysis and architectures, so I've gotten really good at various parts of the AWS suite. I can do other things, like cook. Recently, I've been experimenting with a blowtorch to make breakfast.</p>
