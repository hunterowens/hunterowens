  <h2>Tools</h2>
  <p>I turn to Python and Javascript most often, with a smattering of Julia, Java/Scala, and C when I feel like it. I really like the idea of reproducible analysis and architectures, so I've gotten really good at various parts of the AWS suite. I can do other things, like cook. Recently, I've been experimenting with a blowtorch to make breakfast.</p>
