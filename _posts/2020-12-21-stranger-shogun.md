Amy Stanley's the Stranger in the Shogun's City was perhaps the best "read it on a lark" and was totally ingrossed by it book of the year for me. Stanley paints a portrait of Edo before the Meiji Restoration by recounting the live of a countryside daughter of a priest who feels to Edo. Impressive work!
