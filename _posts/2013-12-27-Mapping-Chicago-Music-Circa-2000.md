The University of Chicago's Jazz Collection in the Special Collection has an awesome archieve, that is, the Dan Grzeca collection between 1997 and 2006. I stumbled across this collection while doing some research for a course, and noticed how awesome the posters are. Grzeca is a poster artist who did posters for shows and bands across the country, but mostly Chicago through today. They look awesome. I took some photos.
