Because [Julia Preito](https://twitter.com/juliaprieto) asked for the recipe, here goes.

Challah Stuffing is awesome. 

### Things you're going to need.

	1. Challah
	2. Homemade Turkey Stock [You can sub homemade chicken stock, but I like turkey]
	3. Onion
	4. Celery
	5. Mushrooms (optional)
	6. Carrots (optional)
	7. Sausague (optional)
	8. Parmesan Cheese (optional)
	
### Steps
Procure a challah. (or 2, or 3). Cube and leave in plastic/paper bags for a day. Make the stock this day if you haven't allready. 

Next: Saute Onion, Celery, Mushrooms, Carrots & Sausage until soft. Salt/Pepper/Season here also. Place cubed challah, mixture into pan. Add stock until partially soft (the amount of stock you add changes the text. Less for firmer stuffing, more for really moist. Avoid having pools of liquid.). Place in 350 degree oven until crust forms. If you want, top with Parmesan cheese because, well, awesomeness. 

### Homemade Stock
I cannot stress how important the homemade stock is here. So make it, because it makes the dish. 

	1. 1 Roasted Turkey Carcass/1 Pounds Roasted Chicken Bones+Necks
	2. 2 Onions (Peel removed, halfed)
	3. 2 Carrots
	4. 2 Stalks Celery
	5. 3 Bay Leaves
	6. Salt + Pepper (Whole)
	
Place all ingredents in pot. Cover with water. Bring to a simmer for at least 3 hours. Skim foam occasionally. Strain. Can freeze stock for up to 6 months.
